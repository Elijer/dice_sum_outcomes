# Okay so
Ruleset to pushes simplified gameplay in which there are only 6 moves, 1-6. For further simplification, instead of all of the addition business from before, you just get to pick one dice out of however many you rolled.

So 1 Dice outcomes are the same, but the others will be different.

Okay so I quickly realized, if you just pick one dice out of n, then the probabilities for each are the same. So this is great news because
1. If I want to keep the old rules but just for the numbers 1-6, I can just keep the same calculations I already made
2. If I _was_ interested in nixing the variations in move likelihood, I have an out on that.
